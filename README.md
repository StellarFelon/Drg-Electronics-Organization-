# Drg-Electronics-Organization-

This is a space for organizing files and models for parts allowing for easy printing in the future if it needs to be expanded its relativley rudimentary as is 
We will use custom made parts made to fit the gridfinity organization system
we will use magnets as the connector allowing for easy (and fun) organization
the magnets should be 6*2 mm and parts for the system can be easily made on this site: https://gridfinitygenerator.com/en
